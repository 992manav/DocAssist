This would greatly reduce treatment-related morbidity and be predicted to improve survival. GATA2 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) across a retrospective multi-institutional cohort of 195 primary USCs. Associations between GATA2 levels and clinicopathologic metrics were evaluated using Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards ratio. Invasion in patient-derived USC cells was assessed by Student's t-test. RNA-seq, anti-GATA2 ChIP-seq, and confirmatory western blotting enabled identification of GATA2 targets. Patients with FIGO stage I GATA2high USCs had 100% recurrence-free and 100% cancer related survival, which was significantly better than patients with GATA2low USCs. In patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted, patients with GATA2high USC had 100% recurrence free 5-year survival compared to 60% recurrence free survival in patients with GATA2low USC. Depletion of GATA2 in patient-derived USC cells increased invasion in vitro. Routine GATA2 IHC identifies 33% of FIGO stage I USC patients who have a greatly reduced risk of post-hysterectomy USC recurrence. Our results suggest that a GATA2 guided personalized medicine approach could be rapidly implemented in most hospital settings, would reduce treatment-related morbidity, and likely improve outcomes in USC patients.

Acceleration, particularly those collected through wearable sensors, has been increasingly adopted as an objective measure of physical activity. However, sensor-based measures often pose challenges for large-scale studies due to their associated costs, inability to capture contextual information, and restricted user populations. Smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers an unobtrusive and undemanding means to measure PA to address these limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the usability of EMA by comparing its measurement outcomes with 2 self-report assessments of PA: Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and a modified version of Bouchard Physical Activity Record (BAR). A total of 235 participants (137 female, 98 male, and 94 repeated) participated in one or more 7-day studies. Waist-worn sensors provided by ActiGraph captured accelerometer data while participants completed 3 self-report measures of PA. The multilevel modeling method was used with EMA, GPAQ, and BAR as separate measures, with 6 subdomains of physiological activity (overall PA, overall excluding occupational, transport, exercise, occupational, and sedentary) to model accelerometer data. In addition, EMA and GPAQ were further compared with 6 domains of PA from the BAR as outcome measures. Among the 3 self-reporting instruments, EMA and BAR exhibited better overall performance in modeling the accelerometer data compared to GPAQ (eg EMA daily: \u03b2=.387, P<.001; BAR daily: \u03b2=.394, P<.001; GPAQ: \u03b2=.281, P<.001, based on repeated-only participants with step counts from accelerometer as dependent variables).

FBLN4 and LTBP4 interact with cells, but their cell receptors and associated molecular elastogenic mechanisms remain unknown. Primary skin fibroblasts and several vascular smooth muscle cells bound strongly to FBLN4 multimers and LTBP4 monomers. We identified two cell interaction epitopes on FBLN4 located in cbEGF2-3 and the C-terminal domain, whereas FBLN4 multimerization sites were mapped to cbEGF4-5 and the C-terminal domain. We also determined a novel cell interaction site in the N-terminal half of LTBP4. Cell binding to FBLN4 and LTBP4 was strongly inhibited in the presence of heparin, heparan sulfate, or after enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate, suggesting heparan sulfate proteoglycans as relevant cell surface receptors. siRNA knockdown experiments identified syndecan (SDC)2 and SDC3 as cell receptors for FBNL4 and SDC3 for LTBP4. Direct protein interactions between FBLN4 and the recombinant ectodomains of SDC2 and SDC3, and between LTBP4 and SDC3 validated these results. Interaction of the elastogenic cells with FBLN4 and LTBP4 enhanced elastogenesis, whereas SDC2 and/or SDC3 knockdowns led to reduced elastic fiber formation. The cell interactions with FBLN4 and LTBP4 significantly enhanced focal adhesion formation, induced cell contraction, and led to activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Erk1/2, and RhoA. Pharmacological inhibition of these effectors markedly attenuated elastic fiber formation, and siRNA knockdown of SDC2 and SDC3 led to reduced levels of pFAK, pERK, and active RhoA. Together, these data demonstrate that FBLN4 and LTBP4 cell interactions through SDC2 and SDC3 promote elastogenesis by enhancing focal adhesion formation, leading to cell contractility through FAK, Erk1/2, and RhoA activation, underscoring the significance of these pathways in elastogenesis.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "publication_date": "2025-Apr-15", "doi": "10.1096/fj.202402767R", "authors": ["Hana Hakami", "Neha E H Dinesh", "Valentin Nelea", "Nathalie Lamarche-Vane", "Sylvie Ricard-Blum", "Dieter P Reinhardt"], "mesh_headings": []}

Here, we analyzed molecular profiles of 108 alectinib-treated patients (first-line and second-line after crizotinib) with confirmed relapse by targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. After first-line treatment, off-target MET and NF2 alterations were more frequent than on-target alterations within the first 6\u2009months, causing primary or early resistance. Conversely, on-target alterations became prevalent after 1\u2009year of first-line alectinib treatment and predominantly after second-line. The incidence of acquired resistance also depended on EML4-ALK variants. In variant 1 (v1), off-target alterations were responsible for 50% of resistance cases after first-line alectinib therapy, whereas on-target mutations had no contribution in this subgroup. In variant 3 (v3), on-target alterations resulted in 46% of resistance cases, whereas only 18% were caused by off-target mutations. After second-line treatment, the most common mutations in v1 were L1196M (42%) and G1269A (25%), while G1202R was detected in 45% of v3 tumors.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, growing numbers of critical care patients required indwelling urinary catheters, leading to higher infection rates. A critical care unit saw a 7-fold increase in the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of procedures showed that the current standard of care for preventing such infections was inadequate. In particular, patients who could not have indwelling urinary catheters promptly removed risked a potential false-positive diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection due to clinicians' use of long-term catheters to obtain urine specimens for microbiological evaluation. A literature review was performed to gather evidence on best practices for urine specimen collection in the critical care unit. An interprofessional task force including frontline nurses advocated implementation of a pilot project in 2 critical care units involving exchange of catheters before obtaining urine specimens for microbiological evaluation in any patient who had an indwelling catheter in place for more than 24 hours. Implementation of the new protocol resulted in a major reduction in the diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, with no incidents occurring for 2 consecutive quarters. Based on these results, the new evidence-based workflow was incorporated as the standard of care for all adult inpatients. Catheter exchange before collection of urine specimens in patients requiring urine culture evaluation can improve accuracy of diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection and promote antibiotic stewardship.", "journal": "Critical care nurse", "publication_date": "2025-Apr-01", "doi": "10.4037/ccn2025857", "authors": ["Kathleen Romano", "Jessica Leone", "Nora Love", "Amy Caramore"], "mesh_headings": []}

Tissue biopsy, albeit the gold standard, is invasive, costly and provides limited information about the tumor and its molecular landscape. Exosomes, as promising biomarkers for lung cancer, are a heterogeneous collection of membranous vesicles containing tumor-specific information for liquid biopsy to identify lung cancer subtypes. However, the small size, complex structure, and heterogeneous molecular features of exosomes pose significant challenges for their effective isolation and analysis. Herein, we report a deep learning-driven microfluidic chip with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) readout to characterize the differences in exosomes for the early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This integration comprises a processing unit for exosome capture and enrichment using polystyrene microspheres (PS) binding gold nanocubes (AuNCs) and anti-CD-9 antibody (denoted as PACD), and an optical sensing unit to trap the PACD and detect SERS signals from these exosomes. This system achieved a maximum trapping efficiency of 85%, and could distinguish three different NSCLC cell lines from the normal cell line with an overall accuracy of 97.88% and an area under the curve (AUC) of over 0.95 for each category.

The mRNA-seq data comprising 699 human glioma samples of different grades from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed to explore the relationship between RASL11A expression and clinical outcomes in glioma patients. RASL11A was overexpressed in U251 cells and knocked out in U87 cells, with subsequent assays to evaluate its impacts on radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing was performed and p-STAT3 levels were assessed in GBM cells following IR treatment. Analysis of mRNA-seq data from 699 glioma samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that higher RASL11A expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that RASL11A overexpression in U251 cells or RASL11A knockout in U87 cells significantly affected radiosensitivity. Cells with higher RASL11A levels exhibited increased clonogenic survival, reduced G2/M arrest, decreased \u03b3-H2AX levels, and lower apoptosis rates after X-ray IR. In vivo studies corroborated these findings, showing larger tumor volumes and weights, along with decreased levels of C-Caspase 3 and increased Ki67 expression in RASL11A-overexpressing U251 tumors with IR treatment.

However, a noninvasive tool for accurately and reliably predicting the PNI is lacking. The clinical and imaging data of 278 patients from institution I and 39 patients from institution II were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic features were extracted from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions. Seven independent machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to develop the models. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis were carried out to compare 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) differences among various subgroups based on PNI and radiomic scores. T stage and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significantly correlated with the PNI (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The OS of patients with different PNI status was significantly different (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Gradient boosting tree is the best ML algorithm. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of the optimal radiomics model in the internal test set and external test set were 0.901 and 0.886, respectively. After the introduction of clinical variables T stage and LVI, the performance of the model further improved in predicting the PNI of GC patients, with the AUC of 0.904 in the internal test set and 0.886 in the external test set. The difference in 3-year OS (P\u2009=\u20090.005) and 5-year OS (P\u2009=\u20090.015) among patients with varying radiomic scores was statistically significant. Radiomics combined with intratumoral and peritumoral features is feasible for evaluating the PNI of GC patients.

This study aims to evaluate the interrater agreement of MRI NI-RADS among radiologists with varying levels of expertise in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. We designed an observational retrospective study to identify follow-up MRIs in patients who had undergone radiation therapy. Five radiologists (2 head and neck experts, 1 general radiologist, and 2 residents in radiology) scored each MRI using NI-RADS. Kappa (\u03ba) and percentage of agreement (POA) were calculated for the ultimate score and for each individual feature of the NI-RADS (primary tumor size, signal on T2-weighted images, contrast enhancement, diffusion restriction, and lymph node size). Agreement was analyzed also separately for the first follow-up MRI and subsequent scans. Thirty patients were included (a total of 97 MRIs per rater). Interreader agreement between all readers was moderate for NI-RADS (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.41; POA\u2009=\u200981%). The first follow-up showed a low reliability between the head and neck expert radiologist and the two radiology residents for both primary tumor contrast enhancement and size assessment (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.02; POA\u2009=\u200931% and \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.17; POA\u2009=\u200938%, respectively), while there was a high level of agreement in the analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.79; POA\u2009=\u200996%).
